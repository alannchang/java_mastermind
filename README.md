# Mastermind

## Objective
To implement a Mastermind game, where a user plays against the computer and tries to guess a number combination or "code". At the end of each attempt, the computer will tell the player how many numbers are correct numbers and how many numbers are in the correct position/location. Players are only allowed a fixed number of attempts to correctly guess the number combination.

## Requirements Checklist

### Core Game Requirements
- [X] Randomly select a pattern of **4 numbers** (0â€“7) at game start (duplicates allowed)
- [X] Use **Random.org Integer Generator API** for number selection
- [X] Player has **10 attempts** to guess the combination
- [X] After each guess, provide feedback:
  - [X] Number of correct digits (regardless of position)
  - [X] Number of correct digits in the correct position
  - [X] "All incorrect" message if no matches
- [X] Do **not** reveal which numbers are correct
- [X] End game when:
  - [X] Player guesses correctly within 10 attempts (win)
  - [X] Player fails after 10 attempts (lose)

### User Interface
- [X] Allow player to enter 4-number guess
- [X] Display guess history with feedback
- [X] Show remaining attempts

### API Integration
- [X] Send HTTP GET request to `https://www.random.org/integers`
- [X] Parse API response into the secret combination

### Other
- [X] Tests using JUnit, etc.
- [X] Logging using slf4j   (IN PROGRESS)
- [X] Error & exception handling
- [X] Input validation
- [X] Proper resource management
- [X] JavaDocs
- [X] Follow SOLID principles
  - [X] Single Responsibility
  - [X] Open/Closed Principle
  - [X] Liskov Substitution Principle
  - [X] Interface Segregation Principle
  - [X] Dependency Inversion Principle
 
### Extensions/Extras (Optional)
- [X] Add ability to check random.org api quota
- [X] Add configurable difficulty (number range / attempts)
- [X] Add ability to load/save games, history, etc. (persistence using a database)
- [ ] Add hint system
- [ ] Add multiplayer mode
- [ ] Keep score across games
- [ ] Add timers (per guess or per game)
