### 8/11
- Created repo, added Gradle
- Added support for random number generation using Random.org API and local pseudo random generation as a fallback

## Checklist
### Core Game Requirements
- [ ] Randomly select a pattern of **4 numbers** (0â€“7) at game start (duplicates allowed)
- [X] Use **Random.org Integer Generator API** for number selection

  - [ ] Player guesses correctly within 10 attempts (win)
  - [ ] Player fails after 10 attempts (lose)

### User Interface
- [ ] Allow player to enter 4-number guess
- [ ] Display guess history with feedback
- [ ] Show remaining attempts

### API Integration
- [X] Send HTTP GET request to `https://www.random.org/integers`

- [ ] Logging

### Extensions (Optional)
- [ ] Add hint system
- [ ] Add configurable difficulty (number range / attempts)
- [ ] Add multiplayer mode
